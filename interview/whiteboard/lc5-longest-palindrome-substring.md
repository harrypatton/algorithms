# LC5 - Longest Palindrom Substring
*Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.* [Source](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/#/description)

## Analysis
1. It is easy for me to find DP and iterative solution. Both are time O(n^2). DP needs space O(n^2), but iterative solution just needs O(1). 
2. I know wiki shows a linear solution but it is too complicated.

## Whiteboard
1. I can write the algorithm but get a little bit stuck when think about edge cases. I realize the normal code can cover all edge cases. Before that, I still wrote some code and then erased later. 
2. In whiteboard coding, I should start with normal cases but leave with some spaces so I can add code for edge cases if necessary later. It would help me to focus on main scenario and also have spaces to think about edge cases later.

**Update**: whiteboard coding quality is high. Just miss the return statement. One time pass.
