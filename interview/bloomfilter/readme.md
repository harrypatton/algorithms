It is a good way to check if an element exists or not.

High efficiency in terms of both time and space; however, it has false positive results.

1. when it doesn't find an element, it is absolutely true.
2. when it does find an element, it may exist (or not). A combination of other existing elements may have a false report that the new element exists.
